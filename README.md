## Polymer elements for testing

This repo hosts polymer elements in the gh-pages branch. The elements are in refreshed from the polymer's bower repositories and can be included directly to an online editor like jsbin.com by placing the following in the &lt;head> tag:

```
<base href="http://shauvik.com/polyments/">
  <script src="bower_components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>
  <link rel="import" href="bower_components/iron-elements/iron-elements.html">
  <link rel="import" href="bower_components/paper-elements/paper-elements.html">
```
